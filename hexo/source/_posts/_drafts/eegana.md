Introduction
===

Data analysis, in my perspective, is obtaining the wanted information from a bunch of numbers. Therefore, the data analysing method should heavily depends on what kind of information you want. In terms of EEG data analysis, this information could be brain conectivity etc. However, there are some general method applicable in most task, which will be introduced in this post.

The very first step of EEG data analysing, same with other data analysing, should clean the data. Therefore we need to understand what the signal should looks like and what the nosize should be. The phisiology introduction of EEG data is in section (ref). Types of noize is introduced in (ref). For different types of noize, we need different method of to clean them (ref).

Besides cleaning, using proper technics to transform data can also make the signal more obvious. Time-domain analysis of ERP is in (ref). There are several methods for aquisition of time-frequency figure (ref).
