<p>Researches study our neural system in different levels: from conponents<br>of a single cell, such as membrane, to the connection of two cells<br>(synapsis), and further to the complex network of the whole brain. This<br>summary trying to find a straight pathway of the modeling from<br>sub-cellcular level to simple neural network. Please refer @mitcourse<br>for more detail in.</p>

<h1 id="Membrane"><a href="#Membrane" class="headerlink" title="Membrane"></a>Membrane</h1><p>Membrane has roughly two parts that are vital in the neural activity:<br>phospholipid bilayer and channels (FIG. [structMemb]). phospholipid is<br>permeterbale for water, oil etc., yet impermmitable for ions. This<br>attribution is similar to semi-permeable membrane. Ions carry charges,<br>if the charge densities of the two sides of phospholipid bilayer (intra<br>celluar space and extra-cellcular space) are different, there will be a<br>votage across cell membrane (FIG. [semiMemb]). In all, because of the<br>existance of phospholipid bilayer, the cell has a function similar to<br>conductance</p>
<p>$$c V = Q<br>  \label{capt}$$</p>
<p>where $c$ is the conductance per unit area, $Q$ is the charge density<br>differences and $V$ is the votage accross the cell. The votage of the<br>extra-cellcular space is set to be zero, therefore $V$ here is also the<br>votage of intra-cellcular space, which is roughly $-70 \text{mV}$ to<br>$ -50 \text{mV}$ as measured by the experiment.</p>
<p>There are two types of channel: ion channels and metabolic channel. The<br>effect of metabolic channels are more indirect and complex, which is not<br>the center concern of this summary. Ion channel behaviours as the gate<br>of the membrane. It allows only certain types of ions to pass though the<br>membrane, thus produce inward or outward cuurent flow. For example,<br>Na-gated channel is only permitterble to Na$^+$, when the channel is<br>open (FIG. [nachannel]). One good approximation of the channel is<br>resistence, govern by the Ohm’s law</p>
<p>$$I = G_i (V - V_i)<br>  \label{olm}$$</p>
<p>where $G_i$ is the conductance which can depends on the votage and time,<br>and $V_i$ is the equivibrilum votage (constant for a certain type of<br>channel) results from the balance of electric force and diffusion. Index<br>$i$ here means $ith$ type of ion channel. Positive $I$ means outward<br>current.</p>
<h1 id="Single-Cell"><a href="#Single-Cell" class="headerlink" title="Single Cell"></a>Single Cell</h1><p>Differentiate on both side of equation ([capt]) and use equation<br>(<span>[olm]</span>), we have an equation for single cell</p>
<p>$$c \frac{dV}{dt} = - G_L (V - V_L) - I_e<br>  \label{ifmodel}$$</p>
<p>where $I_e$ is the extra-induced current, such as the experimentist<br>inject ions to the cell (negtive $I_e$). Index $L$ is leakage channel,<br>which is a mathematically equvilent channel of partial function of some<br>types of channel (largely fall into K-selective channel). The rest of<br>effects of channels can be simplified as the following statement:</p>
<ul>
<li>If $V &gt; V_{th}$, $V = 50 \text{mV}$, then quickly fall to $V_{res}$.<br>[ifstate]</li>
</ul>
<p>This effect is often introduced by Na-selective channels. Typical value<br>of $V_{res}$ is $-65 mV$. There are some choices for $V_{th}$, but<br>values like $-30<br>mV$ is sufficient to fit a good result. When this statement is<br>triggered, we say the neuron fired, or it made a spike. This single-cell<br>model also be named Integrate and Firing Model. This model contains one<br>resistence (leakage channel), one conductance (membrane), one external<br>current source ($I_e$), and voltage source (FIG. [ifmodel]). There are<br>lots more sophiscated models, such as HH model, which replace the<br>statement with more realistic channels as additional terms in equation<br>([ifmodel]).</p>
<p>Equation [ifmodel] can be collected with a more susinct form</p>
<p>$$\tau \frac{dV}{dt} = -V + V_{\infty}<br>  \label{ifmodelS}$$</p>
<p>where $\tau = c / G_L$ and $V_{\infty} = (V_L - I_e) / G_L$. If $G_L$<br>here is a constant, solution of equation [ifmodelS] is</p>
<p>$$V = (V_L - V_{\infty}) e^{-t/\tau} + V_{\infty}$$</p>
<p>The firing pattern is shown in FIG. [fpattern]</p>
<p>Information is stored in the firing rate of neurons instead of the exact<br>value of votage. Firing rate is defined as the number of spiks in a unit<br>time. The time spacing between two spikes can be calculated from<br>equation ([ifmodelS]) by calculate the time that $V$ grows from<br>$V_{res}$ to $V_{th}$. The inverse of time spacing is firing rate, as<br>show in FIG. [fireate]. In all, we could conclude the relation with</p>
<p>$$v = F[I_e]<br>  \label{fireateeq}$$</p>
<p>where $v$ is the firing rate, and $F$ is some function has the shape in<br>FIG. [fireate]</p>
<h1 id="Synapse"><a href="#Synapse" class="headerlink" title="Synapse"></a>Synapse</h1><p>Before moving to neural network, we need to understand how two neurons<br>connect each other by synapse. FIG. [syn] shows the biological structure<br>of the synapse. When the pre-neuron is fired, the depolyzation will open<br>the Ca-channel, induces an inward flow of Ca$^{2+}$. This Ca$^{2+}$ will<br>release the transmitters in the presynapse. Transmitter in the synapse<br>cleft then attarch to particular recepters in the post-synapse, open<br>ion-channel to allow Na$^+$ flow into the post-synapse. This final lead<br>to the depolyzation of the post-neuron.</p>
<p>The current flow into the post-neuron can be descripted by</p>
<p>$$I_{syn} = - G_{syn}(t) (V - V_{syn}),<br>  \label{isyn}$$</p>
<p>where $V_{syn}$ is about $0$ mV, which is the reversal potential of the<br>post-synapse. Conductance $G_{syn}(t)$ is shown in FIG. [gsyn] If<br>there’s no transmitters in the synapse cleft, ion channels in the<br>post-synapse are closed, $G_{syn}(t) = 0$ mV. A spike of the presynapse<br>will suddenly release a large amount of transmitters, therefore largely<br>increase $G_{syn}(t)$. Then the transmitters will graduatly either<br>diffuse away or be decomposed by glials, which lead to the slow decay of<br>the conductance. The conductance induced by single spike is often<br>approximated by the exponential function</p>
<p>$$K(t) = G_{max} e^{-t / \tau}.$$</p>
<p>The whole conductance under a train of spikes is</p>
<p>$$G(t) = \sum_iK(t) \delta_{t,t_i}<br>  \label{spikeraw}$$</p>
<p>where there is a spike at time $t_i$. Equation ([spikeraw]) can be<br>simplified with the spike train $S(t) = \sum_i\delta(t - t_i)$</p>
<p>$$G(t) = \int{d\tau}K(\tau)S(t - \tau)$$</p>
<h1 id="Simple-Neural-Network"><a href="#Simple-Neural-Network" class="headerlink" title="Simple Neural Network"></a>Simple Neural Network</h1><p>Consider a network with only two neurons attarched FIG. [twonet]. The<br>working status of each neuron is solely stated by its firing rate. So we<br>need to findout the firing-rate relation between neurons. For the single<br>neuron, the only source of external current is from its pre-neuron, i.e.<br>$v = F[I_{syn}]$ from equation ([fireateeq]). Yet $I_{syn}$ followed by<br>equation ([isyn]) is still too complex to be pratical. Hence we further<br>throw away the votage term, and treat $G_{syn}(t)$ as votage<br>independent,</p>
<p>$$I_{syn} = \int{d\tau}K(\tau)S(t - \tau)$$</p>
<p>we could extract a factor $w$ so that the rest of<br>$U(\tau) = K(\tau) / w$ can be normalized,</p>
<p>$$\int{d\tau}U(\tau) = 1$$</p>
<p>The convolution of a narrow (correnspond to short time of non-zero<br>$K(\tau)$) window $U(\tau)$ with spike train $S(\tau)$ is exactly the<br>firing rate of the presynapse $u$. Overall, we have</p>
<p>$$v = F[w u].$$</p>
<p>This equation reveals the simple relation of the network. Larger $w$<br>means the two neurons are more strongly connect, only a slow firing rate<br>of the pre-neuron is enough for triggering the post-neuron. This<br>biologically could mean there are more channels in the post-synapse.<br>Different presynapse will attarch to different sites of the postsynapse.<br>Furthermore, the post-neual layer can also attarch to each other as<br>shown in FIG. . The overall effect is the summation of all their<br>current.</p>
<p>$$\boldsymbol{v} = F[W\boldsymbol{u} + M \boldsymbol{v}],$$</p>
<p>where $W, M$ are matrices, arrays are written as bold letters. This<br>model is called rate model, which is the fundation of the lots of deep<br>learning architechture.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Membrane of the neuron is a conbination of resistor and capacity. The<br>conductances are different under different membrane and more<br>importantly, different to different types of channels. This attribution<br>allows the neuron to fire, and soon go back to the rest potential. A<br>spike from the pre-neuron will triggered a bit depolyzation of the<br>post-neuron. Once there is enough depolyzation, the post-neuron will<br>also make spikes. Despite the complicated procedure for generating a<br>spike, the exact voltage is unimportant. The real information is stored<br>in the frequency of the spikes, which can be described using a single<br>number – firing rate. By carefully simplify the synapse conductance, one<br>could obtain a relation between the firing rate of neurons, thus have a<br>neuron network. This neuron network also lies in the basis current deep<br>network algorithms.</p>
